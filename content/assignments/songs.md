## Getting Started

> 1. Open your CS50 Codespace.
> 2. In the terminal window, run
>
```
wget https://scienceacademy.github.io/web/songs.zip
```

> to download a zip file of the lab code.
>
> 3. In the terminal window, run `unzip songs.zip` to unzip (decompress) the file.
> 4. In the terminal window, run `cd songs` to change directories into your `songs` directory.

_**OR**_

> You can also use the file locally. Download the link above on your computer and then go to this link:

You've been provided with a file called `songs.db`, a SQLite database containing data from Spotify about songs and artists. It contains the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify in 2023.

Run `sqlite3 songs.db` to to open the database and run queries.

First, try typing the command `.schema`. This will output the `CREATE TABLE` statements that were used to create the tables in the database. By looking at them, you can see the columns available in each table.

## Assignment

For each of the following problems, write a single SQL query that outputs the specified results. You **should not** assume anything about the `id`s of particular songs or artists (your queries should work even if the `id` of any song or artist were different). Finally, each query should only return the data necessary to answer the question, nothing more.

* In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in the database.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
* In 2.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all songs in increasing order of danceability.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
* In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of the top 5 oldest songs, in ascending order of release year.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
* In 4.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of any songs that have danceability, energy, and valence greater than 75.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
* In 5.sql, write a SQL query that returns the average energy of all the songs.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the average energy.
* In 6.sql, write a SQL query that lists the names of the most streamed songs that are by Post Malone.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each song.
* In 7.sql, write a SQL query that returns the name of the song by The Weeknd with the highest bpm.
  * Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row containing the song names.
* In 8.sql, write a SQL query that lists how many songs by Taylor Swift are in each musical key, in descending order (greatest to fewest).
  * Your query should output a table with a two columns for the name of each key and the count of songs in that key.
