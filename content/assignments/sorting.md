Analyze three sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use.
<!--more-->

## Background

In class, we saw a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.

* Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
* Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
* Merge sort recursively divides the list into two and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

## Getting Started

1. Open your CS50 Codespace.
2. In the terminal window, run `wget https://scienceacademy.github.io/web/lab3.zip` to download a zip file of the lab code.
3. In the terminal window, run `unzip lab3.zip` to unzip (decompress) the file.
4. In the terminal window, run `cd lab3` to change directories into your `lab3` directory.

## Instructions

You've been provided with three already-compiled C programs, `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!). Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each program.

* `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3` are binary files, so you won’t be able to view the C source code for each. To assess which sort implements which algorithm, you'll need to run the sorts on different lists of values.
* Multiple `.txt` files have been provided to you. These files contain `n` lines of values, either reversed, shuffled, or sorted.
    * For example, `reversed10000.txt` contains 10,000 lines of numbers that are reversed from 10000, while `random100000.txt` contains 100000 lines of numbers that are in random order.
* To run the sorts on the text files, in the terminal, run `./[program_name] [text_file_name]`.
    * For example, to sort `reversed10000.txt` with `sort1`, run `./sort1 reversed10000.txt`.
* You may find it helpful to time your sorts. To do so, run `time ./[sort_file] [text_file.txt]`.
    * For example, you could run `time ./sort1 reversed10000.txt` to run `sort1` on 10,000 reversed numbers. At the end of your terminal’s output, you can look at the `real` time to see how much time actually elapsed while running the program.
* Record your answers in `answers.txt`, along with an explanation for each program, by filling in the blanks marked `TODO`.

## Hints

The different types of `.txt` files may help you determine which sort is which. Consider how each algorithm performs with an already sorted list. How about a reversed list? Or shuffled list? It may help to work through a smaller list of each type and walk through each sorting process.
